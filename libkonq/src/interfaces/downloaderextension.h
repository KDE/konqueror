/**
 * @brief Interface for parts which need to download files themselves before they're opened or embedded instead of letting Konqueror do it
 *
 * This interface provides two pure virtual methods, downloadJob(), which returns a DownloaderJob, a `KJob` whose task is to perform the download and part(),
 * and a signal, downloadAndOpenUrl(), to be used instead of `KParts::BrowserExtension::openUrlRequest`.
 *
 * Most likely, when creating a class implementing this interface, you'll also need to create a concrete class deriving from DownloadJob.
 *
 * @warning When a part requests to download the URL itself, Konqueror doesn't try to auto-detect the mimetype of the URL, assuming that the
 * part has already tried to do so and passed the correct value to downloadAndOpenUrl().
 *
 * @note The part doesn't need to implement this interface itself: it can be implemented by any of its children.
